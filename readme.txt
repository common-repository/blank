A completely blank custom page template to build on.

== Description ==

A completely blank custom page template to build on.

Blank includes two extremely minimalist (and when I say minimalist, I mean this probably isn't what you're looking for) custom page templates, *Blank* and *Creative*.

**Blank** — Blank is truly, well, blank. It will literally output nothing, except for exactly what you enter into the page content area (not even the doctype, html, head, or body tags are there by default).

**Creative** — Creative is just Blank, but includes the doctype, html, head, and body tags as well as scripts and styles output by WordPress, your theme, and plugins by default.

**Notes**

* To set a template, select "Blank" or "Creative" under *Page Attributes > Template* when editing a page.
* Neither option will include any actual visible content from your theme: logo, menu, footer, etc.
* If you would like to extend the usefulness of the plugin by enabling PHP in the post editor, see: [https://github.com/bhadaway/allow-php-in-wordpress](https://github.com/bhadaway/allow-php-in-wordpress).
